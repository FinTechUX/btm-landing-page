                <p>Fantasy golf rewards preparation. While there's always an element of unpredictability—this is golf, after all—the players who consistently finish at the top of their leagues share common habits and strategies.</p>
                
                <p>After years of playing and studying what works, we've identified seven strategies that separate fantasy golf winners from the rest of the pack. Whether you're new to fantasy golf or looking to sharpen your edge, these principles will help you climb the leaderboard.</p>

                <h2>Strategy 1: Follow Current Form, Not Reputation</h2>
                
                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h4><span class="strategy-number">1</span> Form Over Fame</h4>
                    <p>Big names don't guarantee big points. The golfer who finished T40 at the last three events isn't suddenly going to win this week just because they're a major champion.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>The most common mistake in fantasy golf is picking players based on their career achievements rather than their current form. Golf performance is streaky—players go through hot stretches and cold stretches, and recognizing where someone is in that cycle matters more than their world ranking.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What to look for:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Results in the last 4-6 events (not just made cuts, but actual finishes)</li>
                    <li>Strokes gained statistics trending upward</li>
                    <li>Consistency—multiple top-25s beats one top-10 followed by missed cuts</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>A player ranked 50th in the world who has four straight top-15 finishes is a better fantasy pick than a top-10 player who's been struggling for two months.</p>

                <h2>Strategy 2: Master Course History</h2>
                
                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h4><span class="strategy-number">2</span> Course History Matters</h4>
                    <p>Some players just perform at certain venues. Past performance at a specific course is one of the most reliable predictors in fantasy golf.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Golf courses have personalities. Some favor bombers off the tee. Others reward precision iron play. Some have bentgrass greens that certain players love while others struggle on them.</p>
                
                <p>When the PGA Tour returns to the same venue year after year, patterns emerge. The players who consistently perform well at Pebble Beach, Augusta, or TPC Sawgrass aren't just getting lucky—they're showing a genuine fit between their game and the course.</p>
                
                <p><strong>How to use this:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check a player's history at the specific venue going back 3-5 years</li>
                    <li>Look for players who finish well even when their overall season form is mediocre</li>
                    <li>Be skeptical of strong form if a player has historically struggled at the course</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The best fantasy picks often come from combining current form WITH positive course history. When both align, you've found an edge.</p>

                <h2>Strategy 3: Understand What the Course Demands</h2>
                
                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h4><span class="strategy-number">3</span> Match Skills to Courses</h4>
                    <p>Every course tests different skills. Picking players whose strengths match what the course demands is how you find value others miss.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Before each tournament, understand what skills the course will test most:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Long courses:</strong> Favor players who gain strokes off the tee and can reach par 5s in two</li>
                    <li><strong>Tight courses:</strong> Favor accuracy over distance—look at fairways hit percentage</li>
                    <li><strong>Firm and fast conditions:</strong> Favor ball strikers with good approach play</li>
                    <li><strong>Soft conditions:</strong> Favor aggressive players who can attack pins</li>
                    <li><strong>Windy venues:</strong> Favor players with links experience or proven ability in tough conditions</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This is where the strokes gained statistics become invaluable. If a course is going to play long and soft, you want players who rank highly in SG: Off the Tee and SG: Approach. If it's a second-shot course with tricky greens, SG: Approach and SG: Putting matter more.</p>

                <h2>Strategy 4: Leverage the Leaderboard</h2>
                
                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h4><span class="strategy-number">4</span> Play the Standings</h4>
                    <p>Your strategy should shift based on where you sit in your league. Leaders play it safe. Chasers take calculated risks.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Fantasy golf isn't played in isolation—you're competing against specific opponents. Your position in the standings should influence your picks:</p>
                
                <p><strong>If you're leading your league:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pick reliable, high-floor players who consistently make cuts</li>
                    <li>Avoid boom-or-bust options that could lose ground to your competitors</li>
                    <li>Match your competitors' likely picks to neutralize their potential gains</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>If you're chasing:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take calculated risks on high-upside players</li>
                    <li>Differentiate from the leader's likely picks</li>
                    <li>Look for players who could win or finish top-5, not just make the cut</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The goal isn't always to maximize your own score—it's to beat your opponents. Sometimes that means playing it safe; sometimes it means swinging for the fences.</p>

                <h2>Strategy 5: Don't Overreact to One Week</h2>
                
                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h4><span class="strategy-number">5</span> Sample Size Matters</h4>
                    <p>One bad week doesn't make a player a bad pick. One great week doesn't make them a must-start. Look at patterns, not individual results.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Golf has more variance than almost any other sport. The difference between finishing 1st and 25th can be a couple of putts over four days. One week of results tells you very little.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Avoid these traps:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The knee-jerk drop:</strong> Abandoning a player after one bad week when their underlying stats are still strong</li>
                    <li><strong>The hot hand fallacy:</strong> Assuming a player who won last week will automatically contend this week</li>
                    <li><strong>The missed cut panic:</strong> Treating a missed cut as a crisis when the player was one shot away from making it</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Look at rolling 12-week averages rather than single-week results. A player who averages T20 over three months with one missed cut is more reliable than a player who alternates between T5s and missed cuts.</p>

                <h2>Strategy 6: Pay Attention to the Narrative</h2>
                
                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h4><span class="strategy-number">6</span> Read Between the Lines</h4>
                    <p>What players say in press conferences, equipment changes, injury hints—the narrative often reveals information the stats don't show.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>The PGA Tour is covered extensively. Players give interviews, make equipment changes, deal with injuries, and experience life events that affect their performance. Paying attention to the narrative can give you an edge:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Equipment changes:</strong> A player switching putters or drivers often signals they're working through something</li>
                    <li><strong>Injury reports:</strong> Nagging injuries that don't force withdrawals still affect performance</li>
                    <li><strong>Life events:</strong> New babies, family issues, or major life changes can impact focus</li>
                    <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Is this a player's favorite event? Are they defending a title? Do they have something to prove?</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>You don't need to become a golf media expert, but staying loosely informed about what's happening on tour helps you catch signals that pure stats miss.</p>

                <h2>Strategy 7: Have a System and Stick to It</h2>
                
                <div class="strategy-card">
                    <h4><span class="strategy-number">7</span> Process Over Outcome</h4>
                    <p>Develop a consistent process for making picks. Good process leads to good results over time, even when individual weeks don't go your way.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>The best fantasy golf players have a system. They don't wing it each week based on gut feelings. They follow a process:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Research the course:</strong> What does it demand? Who has played well here?</li>
                    <li><strong>Check current form:</strong> Who's playing well right now?</li>
                    <li><strong>Review the stats:</strong> Whose skills match what the course tests?</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider the standings:</strong> What do you need strategically?</li>
                    <li><strong>Make your picks:</strong> Commit and don't second-guess</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>The specific system matters less than having one and following it consistently. Over a full season, good process beats lucky guesses.</p>

                <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
                
                <p>Fantasy golf rewards players who do the work. While you can't predict every outcome—and upsets happen constantly—you can tilt the odds in your favor by:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Following form instead of chasing names</li>
                    <li>Studying course history and characteristics</li>
                    <li>Adjusting strategy based on your standings</li>
                    <li>Staying informed about the narratives around players</li>
                    <li>Being consistent in your process</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Apply these strategies over a full season and you'll find yourself climbing the leaderboard in your fantasy golf league.</p>
