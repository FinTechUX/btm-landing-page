                <h2>How to Choose the Right Fantasy Golf App</h2>

                <p>The best fantasy golf app depends on what you're looking for. Here are the key factors to consider:</p>

                <ul class="choose-list">
                    <li><strong>Playing with friends vs. public contests:</strong> If you want private leagues with people you know, choose Better than Most or ESPN Fantasy. If you prefer competing against a large pool of strangers for prizes, DraftKings or Underdog are better fits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Free vs. paid:</strong> ESPN Fantasy, Yahoo Fantasy, and PGA Tour Fantasy Golf are free to play. Better than Most is free to download with affordable passes. DraftKings and Underdog require real-money entry fees for each contest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gambling vs. no gambling:</strong> If you want a pure competition experience with no cash prizes or wagering, Better than Most, ESPN, Yahoo, and PGA Tour Fantasy are all non-gambling options. DraftKings and Underdog are paid daily fantasy platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Season-long vs. weekly:</strong> Better than Most, ESPN, and Yahoo support season-long leagues where points accumulate across the entire PGA Tour calendar. DraftKings and Underdog are contest-by-contest, starting fresh each tournament.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile experience:</strong> If you want a dedicated, polished mobile app, Better than Most and Underdog offer the cleanest mobile-first experiences. PGA Tour Fantasy is web-only. ESPN and DraftKings are full-featured but serve many sports, so the golf experience can feel secondary.</li>
                </ul>

                            <p>Better than Most is specifically designed for playing fantasy golf with friends.

                            <p>No. Traditional fantasy golf apps like Better than Most, ESPN Fantasy, and Yahoo Fantasy are not gambling platforms. They offer competition for fun and bragging rights.

                            <p>Season-long fantasy golf (offered by Better than Most, ESPN, Yahoo) lets you compete with the same group across the entire PGA Tour season, accumulating points week after week. Daily fantasy golf (offered by DraftKings, FanDuel, Underdog) is contest-based—you enter individual tournaments with a salary cap and compete for prizes in that single event. Season-long is better for playing with friends; daily fantasy is better for one-off contests.</p>
