Last Updated: 23 Jul 2025

1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, accessing, or using the Better than Most mobile application or website (”Better than Most” or the “App”), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions (”Terms”). If you do not agree with these Terms, do not use the App. These Terms form a legal agreement between you and Better than Most. We may update the Terms periodically; material changes will be notified in-app or by email. Continued use after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

2. Description of Service

Better than Most is a fantasy golf platform that lets users create teams of real golfers and compete with friends purely for fun and bragging rights. The App:
	•	Does not offer real-money gambling or wagering.
	•	Does not award cash or monetary prizes. Any occasional promotional prize will be clearly stated, free to enter, and structured to remain outside gambling regulations.
	•	Provides temporary leaderboards showing standings based on real-world golf performance.

The Service is intended purely for entertainment and skill-based competition.

3. Eligibility and Accounts

3.1 Age Requirement

You must be 18 years or older to use the App. If you are under 18, you are not permitted to register or use Better than Most.

3.2 Account Registration

You must register with a valid email address. Emails are collected solely for authentication and essential account communication (e.g., password resets). We will not send marketing emails unless you explicitly opt in. Keep your information accurate and up to date.

3.3 Account Security

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity under your account. Notify us immediately at [Support Email] of any unauthorized use. We may suspend or terminate accounts for security reasons or breach of these Terms.

4. Fees, Payments, and Credits

Better than Most may offer optional paid features, subscriptions, or credits to cover platform and licensed data costs. These payments:
	•	Are not entry fees for contests and not pooled among users.
	•	Have no cash value, are non-transferable, and are not redeemable for money.
	•	Are processed by third-party payment processors; we do not hold user funds as a wallet or balance.

Refunds are generally not provided once digital services are delivered, except as required by applicable consumer laws. Cancel subscriptions through your app store settings or as otherwise instructed.

5. Fantasy Contest Rules and Gameplay
	•	Team Selection: Pick golfers from upcoming tournaments before line-up lock.
	•	Scoring: Points are calculated from real-world performance per rules displayed in-app.
	•	Leaderboards: Temporary leaderboards show rankings within each league/tournament.
	•	No Prizes by App: Winning confers bragging rights and in-app recognition only. No cash or monetary-value prizes are issued by Better than Most.
	•	Fair Play: Cheating, exploiting bugs, multiple-account abuse, or collusion that undermines fair competition is prohibited.

Disputes about scoring should be reported to us promptly. We may adjust results if underlying data is corrected. Our decisions are final.

6. No Gambling or Wagering on the Platform

Better than Most does not take bets, pool stakes, facilitate private wagers, or distribute winnings. There are no odds, bookmakers, or wagering mechanisms. Because there is no stake required to participate and no monetary prize, the Service is structured to fall outside gambling definitions. Any attempt to use the App to run or publicize gambling pools or unlawful contests is prohibited and may result in account termination. Play responsibly.

7. User Conduct and Prohibited Activities

You agree not to:
	•	Use the App for any illegal purpose, including organizing or promoting gambling.
	•	Harass, threaten, or abuse other users; post defamatory or offensive content.
	•	Impersonate others or misrepresent your identity.
	•	Cheat, hack, exploit bugs, or use bots/automation to gain advantage.
	•	Attempt to access others’ accounts or compromise the App’s security.
	•	Scrape or extract data without permission.
	•	Use the App for spam or unauthorized commercial activities.

Violations may lead to content removal, warnings, suspension, or termination without refund.
